## What is this about?
This is a repository of all my exercises, labs, and other activities in **CSDC105** *Trends in Application Development*

## What software/application is very much needed in the world today?
To be honest that's a hard question to answer, but given this kind of situation that were in right now, I think what's needed is an application that lets you check whether your mental health is doing fine or not in this pandemic driven world. Maybe it sounds simple or not to important but let us know that not only deadly virus where battling but also our mental health. Imagine an application that will help you overcome feelings of loneliness, lessen the weight that the anxiety gives and a lifeline in this trying times. I haven't think of functionalities or features this application provide but I think in the near future this idea will be a great help. We're fighting different wars in our head, lets not forget to be kind. That's it for now.
